VIBE80 Editor for Camel99 Forth
--------------------------------
Vibe 2.2 is a universial block editor written in ANS/ISO Forth by Sam Falvo.
It is used here with written permission from the author. 

Vibe99 began as a port of VIBE but has been expanded to operate even
more like vi. 

It is VERY important to understand that it is NOT like modern editors.
Some people love this way or working. Others ... not so much.

IMPORTANT THINGS TO KNOW
> VIBE99 works in 80 column mode and needs an F18 display or Classic99 Emulator.
> VIBE99 works with a Forth BLOCK file, not DV80 text files.

Starting VIBE80
---------------
1. With the editor assembler cartridge start CAMEL99 FORTH
   Menu option 5 Run program file:  DSK1.CAMEL2xx  (xx is the version)

2. Inside Forth type:  INCLUDE DSK2.VIBE99

3. If you don't have a block file you must make one like this:
   1st switch to decimal numbers:

   DECIMAL  <enter>

   50  S" DSK2.MYBLOCKS" MAKE-BLOCKS <enter>

   This will create a 50K byte file make of 50 1K blocks on disk2.

To start the editor type VI DSK2.MYBLOCKS  <enter>



VIBE starts in COMMAND mode. This mode lets you navigate around the text.

When you want to edit something you must switch to INSERT mode by
pressing the lower case 'i'. (yes only lower case will work)

In INSERT mode you can type new text into the Forth block.

Command Mode keys
 Q -- quits main loop, enter Forth interpreter for more commands
^Z -- Same as Q
 : -- puts cursor at command line below the editor screen  
 0 -- flushleft

 i -- Enter Editing mode ( called INSERT)
 I -- FLUSHLEFT INSERT

 R -- REPLACE
 h -- LEFT
 j -- DOWN
 k -- UP
 l -- RIGHT

<ctrl>f Page forward (next block) 
<ctrl>b Page backward (previous block)

 Z -- WIPE BLOCK
 o -- open and put text in a new line below current line, until <Esc> hit
 O -- open and put text in a new line above current line, until <Esc> hit
 HOME = Goto col 0, line 0
 $ -- Goto end of text in current line

INSERT mode keys
 ^D -- DELETE
 ^H -- BACKSPACE
 ^M   RETURN
  ESC return to command mode
  HOME -- Goto col 0, line 0
\ In Forth interpreter
:X   FLUSH BUFFERS to disk
:WQ  Write buffers close-files and remove VIBE from dictionary

\ DEL BACKSPACE  DEL -- for Unix
