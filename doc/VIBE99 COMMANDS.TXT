VIBE99 Editor for Camel99 Forth
--------------------------------
Vibe 2.2 is a universial block editor written in ANS/ISO Forth by Sam Falvo.
It is used here with written permission from the author. 

Vibe99 began as a port of VIBE but has been expanded to operate more like vi. 

It is VERY important to understand that VIBE is NOT like modern editors.
Like vi, VIBE has two modes. "Visual" mode used to cursor around and changes 
pages and editing mode where you can change the actual text. 
Some people love this way or working. Others ... not so much.
On top of that VIBE is  "BLOCK" editor meaning it does not edit text files 
but rather blocks of file space that are 1024 bytes in size. 

Hardware Requirements
- needs an F18 display for 80 columns or the Classic99 Emulator
- needs the editor Assembler cartridge

Software Requirements to compile VIBE 
- Camel99 Forth version 2.69 or greater
- Camel99 Forth library disk or the following files on DSK1 
   - DSK1.80COL
   - DSK1.RKEY  
   - DSK1.BLOCKS
   - DSK1.TRAILING
   - DSK1.MARKER
   - DSK1.WORDLISTS


Compiling VIBE99
-----------------
1. With the editor assembler cartridge start CAMEL99 FORTH
   Menu option 5 Run program file:  DSK1.CAMEL99  (xx is the version)

2. Place the VIBE99 source file in DSK2. (any disk will work)
3. Start CAMEL99 Forth at the E/A Run program file with: DSK1.CAMEL99 

4. Inside Forth type:  INCLUDE DSK2.VIBE99

5. If you don't have a block file you must make one like this:

   DECIMAL  <enter>
   80  S" DSK2.MYBLOCKS" MAKE-BLOCKS <enter>
   ( mind the space after S"   It is required)

This will create a 80K byte file make of 80 1K blocks on disk2.

6. Select your block file with: USE DSK2.MYBLOCKS   
7. Enter the editor at the last block accessed with EDIT (starts at zero)


VIBE starts in COMMAND mode. This mode lets you navigate around the text.

When you want to edit something you must switch to INSERT mode by
pressing the lower case 'i'. (yes only lower case will work)

In INSERT mode you can type new text into the Forth block.

Command Mode keys

Editing Keys 
^Z -- quits main loop, enter Forth interpreter for more commands
 : -- puts cursor at command line below the editor screen. 
      Any Forth word can be entered 
 0 -- flushleft
 $ -- goto end of line 
 i -- Enter Editing mode. Show 'I' for insert mode top right
 I -- flushleft and insert mode 
 r -- replace one character at cursor (esc not needed)
 u -- Undo all un-written (flushed) changes 

Cursor movement 
 h -- LEFT
 j -- DOWN
 k -- UP
 l -- RIGHT

BLOCK selection 
 <ctrl>f Page forward (next block) 
 <ctrl>b Page backward (previous block)

:n G  <enter> Select a block space required between number and 'G'

 Z -- WIPE BLOCK with "Are you sure prompt"
 o -- open and put text in a new line below current line, until <Esc> hit
 O -- open and put text in a new line above current line, until <Esc> hit

 Copy Paste
 dd -- delete line to clipboard 
 yy -- copy line to clipboard, cursor down 
 P  -- paste clipboard into block 

INSERT mode keys
 ^D -- DELETE
 ^H -- BACKSPACE
 ^M   RETURN
  ESC return to command mode
  HOME -- Goto col 0, line 0
\ In Forth interpreter
:X   FLUSH BUFFERS to disk
:WQ  Write buffers close-files and remove VIBE from dictionary
